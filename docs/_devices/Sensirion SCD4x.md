notes:
  - BLE monitor doesn't support any of the other Bluetooth features (LED control, download of past data etc.), due to the passive way of getting the data.
  - The protocol is publicly available at Sensirion/arduino-ble-gadget and used to feed data into the Sensirion MyAmbience CO2 App (Android + iOS)
  - The same protocol is used by other Sensirion BLE devices as well, but these have not been implemented yet. If you want support for other Sensirion devices, create a new issue.
