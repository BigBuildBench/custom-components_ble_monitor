notes:
  - This scale is a clone of the Xiaomi Mi Scale (V2), but is using a different BLE advertisement format.
  - For additional data like BMI, viscaral fat, etc. you can use e.g. the [bodymiscale](https://github.com/dckiller51/bodymiscale) custom integration.
  - If you want to split your measurements into different persons, you can use [this template sensor](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/integrating-xiaomi-mi-scale/9972/533)
